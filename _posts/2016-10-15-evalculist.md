Today I started a new open source JavaScript library, [evalculist](https://github.com/calculist/evalculist). It's a safer form of `eval` for executing arbitrary user input JavaScript expressions, and it's a foundational component of Calculist. [Check it out](https://github.com/calculist/evalculist) and use it in your own projects (license MIT). There's plenty of room for improvement. Feel free to fork the repo and open up a pull request!
