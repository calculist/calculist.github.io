	<em>"You can't do much carpentry with your bare hands and you can't do much thinking with your bare brain."&nbsp;</em><br>

<br>
Problem solving requires, among other things,<br>
<ul>
	<li>mental models</li>
	<li>working memory</li>
	<li>attentional control</li>
	<li>computational ability</li>
</ul>
Calculist augments these cognitive resources. Calculist is a thinking tool for problem solvers. Made for students, teachers, scientists, mathematicians, programmers, and anyone who seeks to use their mind more effectively.<br>
<br>
More specifically, Calculist combines the functionality of outliner apps such as&nbsp;<a href="https://workflowy.com/" target="_blank">Workflowy</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">Emacs Org Mode</a> with the computational abilities of apps like Microsoft Excel or&nbsp;<a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a>.&nbsp;The result is a powerful notebook for collecting, organizing, and processing information.<br>
<br>
