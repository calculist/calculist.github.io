<h3>Calculist is on a mission to multiply your cognition.</h3>

<p>
  <span>The human mind is a finite resource.</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Working memory is constrained.</li>
    <li>Attentional control is limited.</li>
    <li>Raw information processing power is in short supply.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We use tools to overcome these limitations.</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing things down enhances memory.</li>
    <li>Editing the contents of one's field of vision enhances focus.</li>
    <li>Using mathematics and computers enhances calculation abilities.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
Calculist unifies these tools into a simple, intuitive interface. Created by [Dan Allison](https://github.com/danallison).
