        <p class="flow-text">Calculist began when its creator Dan Allison was taking math courses and needed a note taking tool that could do inline calculations.</p>
        <p class="flow-text">Following the successful Kickstarter campaign, private beta phase, and many iterations and improvements, Calculist 1.0 will be released in August of 2021.</p>
